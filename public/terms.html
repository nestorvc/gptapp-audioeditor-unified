            <h3>Supported Formats</h3>

                Audio Console supports common audio formats including MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, M4A, M4R, AAC, and WebM. We cannot guarantee processing of unsupported or corrupted audio files.

            <h3>Service Availability</h3>
            <p>
                We strive to maintain service availability but do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service. The service may be temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, updates, or unforeseen circumstances. We are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from service unavailability.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Processing Accuracy</h3>
            <p>
                While we use industry-standard tools and services, we cannot guarantee perfect accuracy for all audio processing operations, including vocal separation, BPM detection, or key detection. Results may vary depending on the source audio quality and characteristics.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
                Audio Console relies on third-party services to provide functionality:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>AWS S3:</strong> For storing processed audio files</li>
                <li><strong>LALAL.AI:</strong> For vocal separation features</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> For usage analytics</li>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT/OpenAI:</strong> As a platform for accessing the service</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Your use of these third-party services is also subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies. We are not responsible for the actions, policies, or practices of these third parties.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            
            <h3>Our Intellectual Property</h3>
            <p>
                Audio Console, including its design, functionality, code, and documentation, is protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted to you are reserved by us.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Your Content</h3>
            <p>
                You retain all ownership rights to audio files you upload. We do not claim ownership of your audio content. However, by using the service, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Process your audio files to provide the requested services</li>
                <li>Temporarily store your audio files on our servers and AWS S3</li>
                <li>Generate processed output files based on your requests</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This license terminates when you delete your files or when files are automatically deleted after 24 hours, whichever occurs first.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Storage and Deletion</h2>
            <p>
                Audio files are stored <strong>solely for processing purposes</strong>. All processed and exported audio files are stored temporarily on AWS S3 and are <strong>automatically deleted after 24 hours</strong> from the time of processing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Important:</strong> We are not responsible for maintaining copies of your processed files beyond the 24-hour period. You are solely responsible for downloading and saving any processed files you wish to keep before the automatic deletion occurs. We cannot recover or restore files after they have been automatically deleted.
            </p>
            <p>
                Source files uploaded for processing are deleted immediately after processing is complete. Only the processed output files are retained for the 24-hour period to allow you to download them.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p>

                <li>Warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose</li>
                <li>Warranties that the service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free</li>
                <li>Warranties regarding the accuracy, reliability, or quality of processed audio files</li>
                <li>Warranties that defects will be corrected</li>
